# Case Study 2: Unsupervised Learning for Customer Shopping Patterns

## Overview  
This project focuses on performing unsupervised learning tasks on the `catalogcrosssell.csv` dataset to uncover customer shopping patterns and provide actionable business insights. 
The goal was to identify customer clusters and understand their behaviors to help the organization tailor marketing strategies effectively. 
This project was completed as part of a group effort, where I contributed significantly to the Python-based data analysis and clustering tasks.

## Analysis  
Using **Python**, I collaborated with my team to preprocess the data, handle missing values, and scale the dataset for analysis. We performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data characteristics and relationships. 
I applied clustering algorithms like **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering** to identify customer segments. We evaluated clusters using techniques like the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine the optimal number of clusters. 
Finally, we interpreted the results to provide actionable insights for the business.

## Results  
- **Customer Segmentation**: We identified distinct customer clusters based on shopping behavior, such as high-frequency buyers and occasional shoppers.  
- **Patterns in Behavior**: Certain clusters showed strong preferences for specific product categories, enabling targeted marketing strategies.  
- **Actionable Insights**: We recommended personalized marketing campaigns and product recommendations to improve customer engagement and sales.
